### myFirstNeuralNetwork
This is a simple practice (just for learning, not real use), which shows a basic structure of a neural network. It is trained to reduce the mean squared loss with Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization algorithm. A list of optimized loss is listed at the end. This network can be used to predict the gender of someone given his/her height and weight.
